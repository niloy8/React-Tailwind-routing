# React + Vite
/**
Frist used a daisy UI component to make a navbar and then created a own navbar using jsx with different routes.
**/
/**
Added a react icon package and use react icons you can use fontawesome and any icon you want. Created a toggle system of the react icon in the Navbar Component.
**/


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
